# Python Implementation of Data Structures
## _Stack_




Stack in Data Structures is a linear type of data structure that follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle and allows insertion and deletion operations from one end of the stack data structure, that is top.

Stack can be implemented using other data structures. In this repo, stack is implemented using the following data strucures:

- List
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List

Note: The output will remain same for all the implementations


## Methods Implemented

Below are the few methods implemented for Singly Linked List.


| Method | Details | Worst Case Complexity (Big-O) |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| is_empty() | Checks Whether the Stack is empty or not | O(1)
| push() | Adds Element at the top of the Stack | O(1)
| pop() | Removes an element from the top position | O(1)
| display() | Traverses and Prints each element in the Stack from top to bottom | O(n)
