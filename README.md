# Python Implementation of Data Structures
## _Singly Linked List_




A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail). Each element in a linked list is called a node. A single node contains data and a pointer to the next node which helps in maintaining the structure of the list..


## Methods Implemented

Below are the few methods implemented for Singly Linked List.


| Method | Details | Worst Case Complexity (Big-O) |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| clear() | Empties the linked list | O(n)
| add() | Adds Element at the end of the Linked List | O(1)
| insert(index) | Inserts element at a specific position | O(n)
| remove(index) | Removes element from a specific position | O(n)
| display() | Traverses and Prints each element in the Linked List | O(n)
